Task Description: Speech-to-Text System
Objective:
Develop a basic speech-to-text system capable of transcribing short audio clips into text using pre-trained models.

Approach:
This system utilizes either:

The SpeechRecognition library with Googleâ€™s Web Speech API for quick online transcription, or

Facebook's Wav2Vec2.0 model via the transformers library for more accurate, offline transcription.

Input:
Short audio clips in .wav format (mono, 16kHz preferred).

Output:
The transcribed text corresponding to the spoken content in the audio file.

Use Case:
This system can be used for voice note transcription, dictation, captioning, or accessibility tools in basic applications.
